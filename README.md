## Description  
This project is an implementation of a **compiler for the MicroJava programming language**, a simple programming language based on Java, developed as part of the **Programming Translators 1** course at the **School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade**. The compiler translates syntactically and semantically correct MicroJava programs into **MicroJava bytecode**, which can be executed on the **MicroJava Virtual Machine (MJVM)**. Detailed project text can be found in Serbian in ```pp1_2023_2024_jan.pdf```, and specification of MicroJava language in ```mikrojava_2023_2024_jan.pdf```.  

The compiler consists of four main phases:  
1. **Lexical Analysis** – Tokenizing the source code.  
2. **Syntax Analysis** – Checking if the code conforms to MicroJava grammar.  
3. **Semantic Analysis** – Ensuring correct usage of variables, types, and function calls.  
4. **Code Generation** – Translating validated code into MJVM bytecode.  

## Features  
- **Lexical Analysis**  
  - Uses JFlex to tokenize MicroJava source code.  
  - Detects identifiers, constants, keywords, operators, and comments.  
  - Reports lexical errors with precise location information.  

- **Syntax Analysis**  
  - Implements a **LALR(1) parser** using AST-CUP.  
  - Constructs an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** from tokenized input.  
  - Recovers from syntax errors and reports them clearly.  

- **Semantic Analysis**  
  - Uses a **symbol table** to verify variable and function declarations.  
  - Detects type mismatches, undefined symbols, and invalid expressions.  
  - Performs contextual checks to ensure program correctness.  

- **Code Generation**  
  - Converts the AST into **MicroJava bytecode** executable on MJVM.  
  - Supports function calls, loops, and conditional statements.  
  - Generates `.obj` files for execution on the MicroJava Virtual Machine.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Java (JDK 1.8)** – Main programming language.  
- **JFlex** – For lexical analysis.  
- **AST-CUP** – For syntax analysis and AST generation.  
- **MJVM Runtime** – For executing generated bytecode.
